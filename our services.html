    <h1>Welcome to Meal Connect</h1>
    <p>Our platform serves as a central hub where hotels can easily upload information about their surplus food. By providing detailed descriptions and quantities, hotels can ensure that NGOs have all the necessary information to efficiently plan and distribute meals to those in need. This streamlined process minimizes waste, maximizes resource utilization, and facilitates a quick and effective response to hunger-related issues.</p>

    <p>For NGOs, Meal Connect offers a user-friendly interface that allows them to access and browse through the available surplus food listings. They can review the location, quantity, and type of food, making it easier for them to plan pickups and distribute meals strategically. Through our platform, NGOs can efficiently coordinate their efforts, reduce administrative burdens, and focus on their core mission of serving the underprivileged.</p>

    <p>At Meal Connect, we prioritize food safety and hygiene. We have implemented rigorous guidelines for both hotels and NGOs to ensure that the food being distributed is safe for consumption. Our platform encourages responsible practices and facilitates communication between parties to address any concerns or queries promptly.</p>

    <p>By harnessing the power of technology and collaboration, Meal Connect empowers hotels and NGOs to work together in an impactful way. Through our platform, we aim to minimize food waste, address hunger and malnutrition, and build stronger communities. Together, we can make a significant difference in the lives of those less fortunate while also reducing our ecological footprint.</p>

    <p>Join us at Meal Connect and be a part of this incredible movement towards a more sustainable and compassionate world. Together, let's make every meal count!</p>
